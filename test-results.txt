1. CORE APPLICATION COMPONENTS
   - Database connections and configurations
   - User authentication and authorization
   - Session management
   - Application routing and navigation

2. BUSINESS LOGIC MODULES
   - User management (create, update, delete users)
   - Website management (multiple websites per user)
   - Content management (pages, templates, shared content)
   - Notification system
   - Analytics tracking
   - Form processing and email services

3. API ENDPOINTS
   - REST API routes for all major functions
   - Data validation and error handling
   - Security middleware
   - Request/response formatting

4. UTILITY FUNCTIONS
   - Helper functions for common operations
   - Data validation routines
   - File and data processing utilities
   - Logging and monitoring components

5. EXTERNAL INTEGRATIONS
   - Azure Storage for file management
   - SendGrid for email delivery
   - Microsoft SQL Server database
   - Azure Active Directory authentication

HOW TESTING WAS CONDUCTED
================================================================================

1. AUTOMATED TEST GENERATION
   - Tests were automatically generated for every code file
   - Each component was tested in isolation
   - Dependencies were "mocked" (simulated) to prevent external system calls
   - Tests verify that code functions exist and can be loaded without errors

2. TEST STRUCTURE
   - Each code file has a corresponding test file
   - Tests check that modules export the expected functions
   - Tests verify that components can be imported without crashing
   - Basic functionality tests ensure core operations work correctly

3. SAFETY MEASURES
   - No real data was accessed during testing
   - No external services were called (email, cloud storage, etc.)
   - Database operations were simulated to prevent data modification
   - All tests run in an isolated, safe environment

4. TEST CATEGORIES
